# Aim
This project investigates the didijet excess observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to identify potential signals of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).

# Methodology
Data Sources: Utilised data from the ATLAS and CMS experiments.
Event Simulation: Employed Monte Carlo simulations to model events where vector bosons decay into dijets.
Analysis: Focused on resonant and non-resonant production models of new particles decaying into jets.
Event Selection: Applied specific criteria to identify and select relevant events, minimizing background noise.
Statistical Analysis: Combined the excess' significance from both the ATLAS and CMS results

# Key Findings
Resonant Production Models: Identified significant signals at specific invariant mass ranges, supporting the hypothesis of new particle resonances.
Acceptance Evaluation: Assessed the impact of detector resolution on the acceptance of signal events.

# Conclusions
The project provided evidence for the dijet excess, suggesting the presence of new phenomena. These findings contribute to ongoing efforts to explore BSM physics and enhance our understanding of particle interactions at high energies.

# Implications
The results offer valuable insights for future LHC experiments and theoretical models, advancing the search for new physics phenomena and guiding subsequent research in particle physics.
